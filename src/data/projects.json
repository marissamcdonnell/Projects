      "description": "My first endeavor into the world of programming. This fun simple game was inspired by a small project required at the end of a free online javascript class. Itâ€™s initial version was built in html, css, and jquery, which has since evolved with React and scss. Squish Fruits is my playground to implement new skills and to try out new packages.",

      "description": "After working on NBA top 50, a similar template was created for Top 20 sports movies. I took some of the components from NBA top 50 and made them reusable in this version of the ranker game. I also restructured the way the calculations were completed to make it more versatile for different data sets.",

      "description": "Another iteration of the ranker game based off of the NBA top 50. The calculations for this ranker were more complicated than the other two, having 5 different positions and wanting the top character without a repeat for those positions. The prior work with top 20 sports movies made many of the other aspects easy to complete the project more quickly.",
